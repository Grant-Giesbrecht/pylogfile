**pylogfile** is an open source, BSD-licensed package for generating rich logs in Python. Pylogfile 
enables log messages to be more useful than traditional logs by embedding markdown, optional 
sub-messages including additional details, timestamps, and log levels. It also provides ways to save
the logs in JSON or HDF formats, with HDF providing a compact binary representation. Furthermore,
the included `lumberjack` script allows log files to quickly be summarized, sorted and searched!
